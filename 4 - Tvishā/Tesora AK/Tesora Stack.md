What a thing? ðŸ¤£.
When I wanted to ask you about ki kya issues hai ? you said koi problem nahi .
then again after a time you say ki wahi
try to understand ki meri life main multiple roles hai ...
mood swings , irritation , physical body , personal health etc etc all.

yeh hi toh cheeze hai jiske bare main puchna chatha ...

want ki yeh sab bhi tum share krr pao...
yeh hi toh meri understanding hai ki ... tumse chooti moti cheezo ka bhi ..puchta jo tum face krr rhi .... about peridos self body changes , legs pain , 
etc etc ... and also mind...

you may think ki tuhmare mental stauts ke bare main nahi janta ...

but i really understand it very well....

about how to thing , what you think ....
how you take decision... etc etc .... 

why you watch movies ? series ? 
why you dont want to trust anyone ?
you dont feel safe .......

 Also, 
 i dont judge you 
 you dont need to explain
 I dont want to like ki ...use against you

you dont need to take load . you can be as your mirror reflection....
as ever....
